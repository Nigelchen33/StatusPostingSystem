            <L><h3>1. What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know about?</h3></L>
            <p>I have done the style file that can put the word in the center of page and as well as the photo.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, i tried to add the pop up windows into my assignment but could not figure out it eventually </p>
            </br>
            <h3>2. Which parts did you have trouble with? </h3>
            <p>The poststatusprocess and the searchstatusprocess are the two parts that i had trouble with. It is not easy for me to connect the database.</p>
            <p>And for each part, i want to check the variables are valid and can send data to database. Sometimes, i just missed a common and the website can not be run</p>
            </br>
            <h3>3. What would you like to do better next time? </h3>
            <p>The design of website and more useful function to make the website more perfect and add more useful method to keep the safety of user input</p>
            </br>
            <h3>4. What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website? </h3>
            <p>The most helpful website for me is the W3school which fully describe functions in PHP, CSS, HTML and so on. Meanwhile, there are have a lot of examples for us to understand the code</p>
            </br>
            <h3>5. What you have learnt along the way? </h3>  
            <p>I have learnt how to connect database with PHP. Sending data to database and get responses. The way to check the valid input. And also the way to use style.CSS.  </p>
